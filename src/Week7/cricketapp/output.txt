Overview:
This will be the output when we run the cricketapp.
In this exercise, I created a ReactJS application called cricketapp to explore modern JavaScript (ES6) features and React components.
I built two components: ListofPlayers and IndianPlayers. 
The ListofPlayers component displays a list of cricket players along with their scores using the map() function, and filters out those who scored below 70 using ES6 arrow functions. 
The IndianPlayers component demonstrates array destructuring by separating odd and even players, and uses the spread operator to merge T20 and Ranji Trophy player arrays. 
I used conditional rendering to switch between the two components based on a flag variable, and later added a toggle button to switch views interactively.
The project helped me understand practical usage of ES6 features like destructuring, spread, and arrow functions in the context of a React application.
